# Chicken Disease Classification

This project aims to classify chicken diseases using machine learning techniques. It provides a framework for data handling, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and validation
- Model training and evaluation
- Metrics visualization (accuracy, confusion matrix)
- Modular code structure

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rakeshkandhi/Chicken-Disease-Classification.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Prepare your dataset in the `data/` folder.

## Usage Example
```python
from models import train_model, evaluate_model
from data import load_data

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = load_data('data/dataset.csv')
model = train_model(X_train, y_train)
evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)
```

## Project Structure
- `data/` — Data loading and preprocessing scripts
- `models/` — Model training and evaluation scripts
- `utils/` — Utility functions
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
